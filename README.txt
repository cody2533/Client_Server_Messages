Hello there! This is our Java TCP messaging program that uses the Windows Command Prompt.
To run the program, you must first run the ServerProcess.java code to allow the server to run. From there, you run ClientProcess to connect to the server. THATS IT!
You will be prompted to enter your name to begin. Upon entering it, you are greeted to the server. 
You are now able to freely type in the chat room with other people that also execute the ClientProcess on the same network.
To leave the chat, you may either type 'exit' or simply close the command prompt.
